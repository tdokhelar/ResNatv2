Installation and Production Instructions
========================================

Feel free to add some more information if you solve installation issues!

Installation with Docker
------------

With the Docker installation, you have all the required softwares installed in two containers (`gogocarto` and `mongo`).

- Clone repository and enter the directory: `git clone https://gitlab.com/seballot/gogocarto.git && cd gogocarto`

* Add your local user to docker group: `/usr/sbin/usermod -aG docker MY_USER`

* Run `make docker-build` to build the container images.

* Run `make up` to launch the containers.

* Enter the `gogocarto` container with this command: `make shell` or `docker exec -it gogocarto bash` (you can execute this one anywhere)

* Run `make init` from within the `gogocarto` container. This will launch all the required commands to finish the installation.

* Go to `http://gogo.localhost:3008/project/initialize` to initialize the project.

### Local docker-compose

If you have a specific environment, need for custom env vars, want to avoid exposing ports, etc, you can create a copy of `docker-compose.yml` named `docker-compose.local.yml` (it will be gitignored).


Manual Install
------------

Main requirements are :

1. PHP 7.4
2. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
3. [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
4. [MongoDB](http://php.net/manual/fr/mongodb.installation.php)
5. Web Server (Apache, Nginx)

Please refer to the dockerfile to know all dependencies : [DockerFile](../docker/Dockerfile)

You can also check [the Debian Buster Installation Guide](./installation_debian.md)

### Cloning Repository

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/seballot/gogocarto.git
```

### Initialize the Project

Create an `.env.local` file containing:

```
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
```

Execute the command:

```shell
make init
```

Now initialize your project with the following route:

`http://localhost/GoGoCarto/web/project/initialize`

Multi Instance Mode (Software As A Service)
--------------------------

Instead of having a single GoGoCarto instance, you can transform your site in a "farm" by turning env variable USE_AS_SAAS to true. Every instance will use a subdomain, i.e if your base url is carto-farm.org, a new instance will be located at mymap.carto-farm.org with it's own database "mymap"
Note : If your base url is already a subdomain, i.e. carto.farm.org, your root database name should equals your root url subdomain name : `DATABASE_NAME=carto`. 


Development wokflow
--------------

Start watching for file changes (automatic recompilation):

```shell
make watch
```

Development : imports between local projects
--------------

For Development on localhost in Multi Instance Mode, if you want to do some imports between your local projects, you will have to declare the subdomains corresponding to gogocarto projects in the /etc/hosts file of the gogocarto container.

Let's say you have two projects :
 - http://project1.gogo.localhost:3008
 - http://project2.gogo.localhost:3008

And you want to import the data of project1 into project2

```shell
docker exec -it gogocarto bash
nano /etc/hosts
```

```shell
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.0.1       project1.gogo.localhost
127.0.0.1       project2.gogo.localhost
```

Then from http://project2.gogo.localhost:3008 create a DynamicImport, with JSON url : http://project1.gogo.localhost/api/elements.json

Please note that we are not using port 3008 because it's the port exposed outside of docker container. As we are doing a request from the container itself, the port 80 is used

### Cron Tabs

Here are the following cron tab you need to configure 

```shell
# for a Normal instance
@daily php GOGOCARTO_DIR/bin/console --env=prod app:elements:checkvote
@daily php GOGOCARTO_DIR/bin/console --env=prod app:elements:checkExternalSourceToUpdate
@daily php GOGOCARTO_DIR/bin/console --env=prod app:notify-moderation

@hourly php GOGOCARTO_DIR/bin/console --env=prod app:users:sendNewsletter
*/5 * * * * php GOGOCARTO_DIR/bin/console --env=prod app:webhooks:post
```

```shell
# for a SAAS instance
* * * * * php GOGOCARTO_DIR/bin/console --env=prod app:project:update
# If you have more than 1400 project, you should run it twice a minute :
* * * * * sleep 30 && php GOGOCARTO_DIR/bin/console --env=prod app:project:update
# Task ran for every projects that need it at once
@hourly php GOGOCARTO_DIR/bin/console --env=prod app:users:sendNewsletter
*/5 * * * * php GOGOCARTO_DIR/bin/console --env=prod app:webhooks:post

@daily php GOGOCARTO_DIR/bin/console --env=prod app:projects:check-for-deleting
# Next one is for custom domain, it works only with NGINX
0 * * * * cd GOGOCARTO_DIR &&bash bin/execute_custom_domain.sh
```

### Updating GoGoCarto

Each time you want to update GoGoCarto, run:

```shell
# With gogocarto user
make gogo-update
```

You can have a look to [the CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) to know what are the new features and breaking changes.
